## Mechanical Engineering Intern (May 2023 - August 2023)
- Utilized NX CAD/CAM software to create process plans, including material drawings and operator sketches using GD&T,
for turbine engine and gas compressor components
- Automated new part processing using Python scripts, resulting in a 67% reduction in estimated man hours
- Designed work holding and modeled fixtures to streamline machining, cutting programming time by 21% in Vericut


## Manufacturing Engineering Intern (June 2022 - August 2022)
- Led the migration of critical data from JobBOSS (ERP system) to Infor LN (formerly BAAN), improving data accessibility and system integration
- Gained hands-on experience on the shop floor, shadowing operations and learning the intricacies of CNC lathes and mills to understand manufacturing processes
- Identified inconsistencies and lack of standardization in manufacturing workflows due to the companyâ€™s acquisition of another manufacturer. Documented these process inefficiencies and potential improvements using Windchill PLM and SFIS (Shop Floor Information System), contributing to a more streamlined and standardized production process
- Worked with QA department to develop inspection plans for new parts and facilitate disposition of non-conforming parts
