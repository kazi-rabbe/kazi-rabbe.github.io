## Design Process
During the design phase, I took inspiration from Black Mirror's metalhead as well as Boston Dynamics' Spot. I was constrained to using 8 servo motors, and thus although a metalhead type design would not be possible, I still wanted to pursue a futuristic design that emulated the femur and tibia's function in the human body.
