title: FLEx Fitness System
description:  FLEx, or the Fitness-Feedback Lifting Experience, is a smart belt and double arm band system tailored for weightlifters. The fitness wearables integrate an array of sensors that identify improper form and insufficient muscle activation to provide real-time correctional haptic feedback and prevent injury. This data, delivered via in-app analytics, helps maximize results in the gym. The userâ€™s role is to strap on and tighten the belt and bands while ensuring correct muscle placement, enter the app, calibrate it, select their desired exercise, and simply begin working out.
